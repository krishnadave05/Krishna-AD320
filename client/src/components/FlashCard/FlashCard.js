        <p>My first sight of the place that some refer to as Kalimpongâ€™s best-kept secret came on a spring afternoon as we were speeding through the town fringed by vernacular architecture. Our local guide made a sharp turn, away from this famed hill station, and all at once, the scenery erupted into a thick curl of terraced fields, fog hanging over meticulously designed Buddhist gompas and valleys carpeted in brilliant green.This is Samthar plateau, a highland of virgin 
          forests, monasteries and uninterrupted views of the Darjeeling Himalayan mountains.
